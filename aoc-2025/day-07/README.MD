## Part 1

Run the simulation and count the occurance of beams reaching the splitter.

## Part 2

Use a cache to attack and conquer the weight (number of beams) calculation.

Remember to give the weight value of at least `1` for each beam stream after the splitter.

Also use int64 or higher precision integer type to avoid int overflow.
